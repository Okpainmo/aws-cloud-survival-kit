# AWS Cloud Survival Kit.

A knowledge dump repository! 

Basically a space where I document and share my wealth of PRACTICAL cloud 
knowledge on provisioning and administering cloud services - with AWS.

> With this, onboarding/mentoring new/junior engineers becomes a lot easier. It also helps a lot, with making the repetitive tasks of cloud engineering a lot faster and smoother - most importantly, if you're a senior(especially a CTO like myself), who works across the whole software development life-cycle. It's simply hard juggling between different engineering domains without having a template to help streamline and ease tasks whenever you're returning to handle such. This project/repository, is my answer to that hassle.

Feel free to star, fork(and own a copy), and also contribute.

## How You Can Contribute.

Just below are some ways you can contribute.

1. Add relevant screenshot(s) that describe each step that a command or process is implementing.

2. Update step explanations - to provide better comprehension for others.

3. Add new(**different**) AWS cloud operation articles/guides - together, let's make the repo a very rewarding space for every AWS cloud engineer that ever get's to visit.

4. ...
