# AWS EC2 Survival Kit.

A knowledge dump repository! 

Basically a space where I document and share my wealth of PRACTICAL cloud 
knowledge on provisioning and administering cloud services - with AWS.

> With this, onboarding/mentoring new/junior engineers becomes a lot easier. It also helps a lot with making the repetitive tasks of cloud engineering a lot faster and smoother - most importantly, if you're a senior(especially a CTO like myself) who works across the whole software development life-cycle. It's simply hard juggling between different engineering domains without having a template to help streamline and ease tasks whenever you're returning to handle such.

Feel free to star, fork(and own a copy), and also contribute.

Cheers!!!
