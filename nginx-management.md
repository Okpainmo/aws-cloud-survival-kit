# Nginx Management.

## Installing Nginx.

Hereâ€™s how to perform a **clean installation of Nginx** on Ubuntu:

### Step 1: Update Your Package List
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Install Nginx
```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

### Step 3: Enable and Start the Nginx Service
```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

### Step 4: Check Nginx Status
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

You should see it **active (running)**.

### Step 5: Verify Installation in Browser or CLI

- Open a browser and visit:  
  ```
  http://your-server-public-ip
  ```
  You should see the **default Nginx welcome page**.

- Or use `curl`:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost
  ```

Would you like help setting up a custom server block (virtual host) now?

### Adding SSl and setting up for reverse proxy-ing.

1. Open nginx config file.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

2. Add the block below, and implement as written in the comment.

```shell
#include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*; - this line does not need to be added if already available - simply add the hashtag to comment it Ensure it is commented

server {
    listen      80;
    listen   [::]:80;
    server_name api.staging.kingofpimall.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
    }
}
```

2. Configure SSL with certbot and let's encrypt.

```bash
sudo apt update

sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

sudo certbot --nginx -d api.zedlabs.xyz
```

**a sample progress response**

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-39-118:~$ sudo certbot --nginx -d api.zedlabs.xyz

```

**if you get the any error regarding the domain not being found(in the server block), that means you failed to add the domain as done in the step 1 of this section. Proceed to update the server name from "_" to as below - as done in the server block above**

```bash
server_name stage.api.terabyte.africa;
```

run the command again

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d stage.api.terabyte.africa
```

3. restart nginx

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

4. then restart you app service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart Terabyte-backend-test-server.service
```

## Removing/Uninstalling Nginx.

### Step 1: Stop the Nginx Service
```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

### Step 2: Uninstall Nginx

#### For just the main package:

```bash
sudo apt remove nginx
```

#### For a full cleanup (including config files):
```bash
sudo apt purge nginx nginx-common
```

### Step 3: Remove Any Leftover Files (Optional)

If you want to delete everything Nginx-related, including custom config files or logs:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/nginx /var/log/nginx /var/www/html
```

### Step 4: Autoremove Unused Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt autoremove
```

You can verify that it's uninstalled with:
```bash
which nginx
```
It should return nothing if Nginx is fully removed.
